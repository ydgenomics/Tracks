    "# Clustering and classifying your cells\n",
    "Single-cell experiments are often performed on tissues containing many cell types. Monocle 3 provides a simple set of functions you can use to group your cells according to their gene expression profiles into clusters. Often cells form clusters that correspond to one cell type or a set of highly related cell types. Monocle 3 uses techniques to do this that are widely accepted in single-cell RNA-seq analysis and similar to the approaches used by Seurat, scanpy, and other tools.\n",
    "In this section, you will learn how to cluster cells using Monocle 3. We will demonstrate the main functions used for clustering with the C. elegans data from Cao & Packer et al. This study described how to do single-cell RNA-seq with combinatorial indexing in a protocol called \"sci-RNA-seq\". Cao & Packer et al. used sci-RNA-seq to produce the first single-cell RNA-seq analysis of a whole animal, so there are many cell types represented in the data. You can learn more about the dataset and see how the authors performed the original analysis at the UW Genome Sciences RNA Atlas of the Worm site.\n"

    "> If you have a relatively large dataset (with >10,000 cells or more), you may want to take advantage of options that can accelerate UMAP. Passing `umap.fast_sgd=TRUE` to `reduce_dimension()` will use a fast stochastic gradient descent method inside of UMAP. If your computer has multiple cores, you can use the `cores` argument to make UMAP multithreaded. However, invoking `reduce_dimension()` with either of these options will make it produce slighly different output each time you run it. If this is acceptable to you, you could see signifant reductions in the running time of `reduction_dimension()`."
